            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h4>1881 - Nottingham’s first civic college</h4>
            <br/>
            Nottingham's first civic college was opened in the city centre in 1881, four years after the foundation
            stone was laid by former Prime Minister, W E Gladstone. An anonymous benefactor had offered £10,000 for a
            college on condition that a suitable building be erected by the Council and that the college should be
            provided with £4,000 a year.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h4>1928 - The move to University Park</h4>
            <br/>
            After the First World War, the college outgrew its original building. A generous gift by Sir Jesse Boot,
            of
            35 acres of land at Highfields, presented the solution and in 1928 the College moved to what is now the
            main
            campus, University Park. Initially, it was accommodated in the elegant Trent Building and was officially
            opened by King George V in November of that year.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Even in its early days on this site, the College attracted high profile visiting lecturers including
            Professor Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi and H G Wells.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h4>1948 – Becoming The University of Nottingham</h4>
            <br/>
            In 1948, the college was awarded the Royal Charter and became The University of Nottingham, now able
            to
            award degrees in its own name. During this period the School of Agriculture was established when the
            Midland
            College of Agriculture at Sutton Bonington merged with the University.
            Continued growth
            <br/>
            The University of Nottingham continued to grow and still focuses on its development.
            <br/>
            The Medical School: In 1970 we established the UK’s first Medical School in the 20th century, and in
            1995
            the School of Nursing was formed following the merger of the Mid-Trent College of Nursing and
            Midwifery. In
            2003 a new campus was opened in Derby City General Hospital
            Jubilee Campus: The £50 million Jubilee Campus development opened in 1999 and subsequently phase two
            opened
            in March 2009. The campus has won numerous awards due to its environmentally-friendly features
            Malaysia Campus: The University opened a campus in Malaysia in 2000. Subsequently a new
            purpose-built park
            campus was opened in September 2005 in Semenyih, Malaysia, close to Kuala Lumpur International
            Airport
            King’s Meadow Campus: In March 2005 The University opened the King’s Meadow Campus in the former
            Carlton
            Television Studios. The campus is home to many of The University’s administrative and support units,
            Manuscripts and Special Collections and two television studios
            China Campus: The University admitted its first students in the city of Ningbo, China in 2004, and
            the
            purpose-built campus was formally opened in February 2006, as part of a joint venture. The
            University then
            became the first foreign university to establish an independent campus in China.
            School of Veterinary Medicine and Science: The University of Nottingham officially opened the School
            of
            Veterinary Medicine and Science in April 2007 (having admitted its first students in September
            2006). It was
            the first purpose-built new veterinary school to be opened in the UK in 50 years
